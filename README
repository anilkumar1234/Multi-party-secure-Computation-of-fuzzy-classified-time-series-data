Instructions:
1)Change your working directory into programs directory in fuzzy folder
2)Open your console and type 'python secure-classification.py'
3)Enter test and training data file names after requesting in console for both users
4)Program will output the result after some time showing progress for work completion of every 1%
5)Result(correct predictions) will be produced

Requirements:
1)Python(2.7)
2)UCRdata
